Disadvantages of shell
========================
1. No error handling
2. OS specific, homogeneous
3. Little complex to understand
4. Not idempotent
5. Complex to handle large number of servers

1. copy the script and dependent files, mongo.repo and mongodb.sh
2. then execute from main server

Configuration management
========================
Install few system packages
Installing Programming runtime
Creating folder
Creating system user
Downloading the code
Unzipping the code
Installing Dependencies
Creating systemctl service files
Staring the application

Baseling/Configuring server is nothing but making it ready to host the application

Deployment -> Downtime
===========
1. Stop the application
2. remove the old code
3. Download new code
4. Install dependencies
5. restart the application

Push vs Pull
============
Push -> Ansible is popular, it recently implemented pull too
Pull -> Chef

BANG -> HYD
==============
DTDC

Polling/Pulling
===============
I go to DTDC everyday and check whether I received courier or not

Event Driven/Push
===============
You carry on, when you get courier it will be delivered

SYS-1 -> Broadcast
SYS-1 -> SYS-2

Linux command == Ansible Module/Collection

dnf install nginx -y
dnf is a command
install and nginx -> arguments

keep all the commands in a file, we call it as shell and run the script

Playbook -> collections of plays, a play is a list of tasks to be executed on the target server

{
	"name": "siva",
	"email": "siva@gmail.com" 
	"password": "siva123"
}

DTO -> Data transfer objects
=======
XML JSON YAML

100 year back go to bank
====================

name
acc no
amount
branch
date
sign

1. Easy to do mistakes
2. Time consuming

Forms == Templates
=====
Name
Acc No
Date
Amount
Sign

XML -> Extensive Markup Language
================================
<Name>Sivakumar</Name>

HTML -> Hyper text markup language
<h1>This is main heading</h1>
<h2>This is side heading</h2>

YAML -> Yet another markup language

indentation -> spacing
